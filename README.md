# AI Tutor Chatbot for Python & Data Structures

This AI tutor is designed for teaching. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to help learners understand Python and data structures rather than only responding to questions.

Unlike standard chatbots, this system acts like a strict professor. It explains concepts step-by-step, identifies shallow understanding, and encourages learners to think more critically.

What Makes This Different

Focuses on teaching, not just quick answers

Uses RAG to base responses on selected learning material

Challenges unclear or incomplete explanations

Specific to Python and data structures, not broad or general

Operates locally with no OpenAI API or usage limits

Key Features

Covers Python basics, data structures, and essential libraries

Provides step-by-step explanations

Detects shallow answers

Adapts teaching style to the learner

Uses FAISS for vector search

Features a clean Streamlit UI

Tech Stack

Python

LangChain (LCEL)

FAISS

HuggingFace (FLAN-T5, Sentence Transformers)

Streamlit

Live Demo

Demo: (add Streamlit link)  
Code: (GitHub repo link)

This is deployed in a free CPU-only environment for demonstration.

Why This Matters

This project shows:

A practical grasp of RAG systems

The ability to create AI with the goal of teaching

An understanding of real-world deployment challenges

System design that goes beyond basic LLM calls
